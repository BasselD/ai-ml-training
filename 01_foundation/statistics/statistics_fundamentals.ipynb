    "- **Population and Sample:** \n",
    "    - Population is the complete pool from which the sample is drawn for further analysis. In other words, a sample is a subset of the population.\n",
    "    - We cannot perform analysis on the full population. It's costly and time consuming. e.g. studying the rate of obesity in the US. It's nearly impossible to record data for every US Citizen (330 M people) Instead, we can use a subset from each state.\n",
    "    - Therefore, it's essential to have a good sample at hand. The sample should be **good representative** of the population.\n",
    "- **Measurement:** it's a number or attribute calculated or measured for each member of the sample.\n",
    "- **Parameter** it's a characteristic of the population. e.g. population mean\n",
    "- **Statistic** it's a characteristic of the sample. e.g. sample mean\n",
    "- **Distribution** it refers to how the sample data is spread across a range of values \n"
