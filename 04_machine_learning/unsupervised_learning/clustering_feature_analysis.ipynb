    "The Cohen's d statistic is a measure of effect size that quantifies the difference between the means of two groups in terms of standard deviation units. While it's commonly used in hypothesis testing to determine the significance of differences between groups, it can also be applied to assess the importance of differences between clusters in a clustering analysis.\n",

    "   - Large Cohen's d values (typically > 0.8) indicate substantial differences between clusters for that feature.\n",
    "   - Small Cohen's d values suggest minimal differences between clusters.\n",
    "\n",
