And boy they were not wrong!  The food was phenomenal. After going back and forth about several options, I finally settled on catfish with a corn salsa, mash potatoes and changed up the green beans for greens based on a recommendation from the waitress. (I wish I did the brussel sprouts because my coworker ordered them and they were beyond phenomenal!The catfish was a nice size and was fresh and crispy!  This meal would have me back regularly!!If your looking for where to go in Chattanooga- come here!!!\",\n",

They were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The pinto beans were delicious. And the coleslaw was so fresh. The wings were amazing.    The service was friendly and fast!      The restaurant was cute, clean, and very open. We sat on the heated outdoor deck and we were comfortable and warm.',\n",

Not that this is where you would expect a Hotel review the Hotel Bo in Chattanooga is a nice bit of nostalgia close to the city center.  Anyway, we needed to get dinner and given the review we saw here it made the cut.I don't know if they accept reservations but we didn't look and arrived to a 45 minute wait.  No big deal. We went to the Bar and 20 minutes later we had a seat at the bar.It turns out that we arrived for Bingo Night and even better, we won! We'll, we along with another couple won an there ended up being a  Rock Paper Scissors run off to determine the eventual winner.  We won that contest too but don't worry, Jhanna made sure that the other party did not go home without something and she bought them a piece of Key Lime Pie.For an appetizer we had the Short Rib Tips along with the Mussels with PBR Sauce and the Short Rib Roast.   Both were great!\",\n",

I opted for a French dip - made with brisket and so tender - love the whole thing and it was accompanied by yummy slaw. Wayne enjoyed a roasted veggie sandwich, and thanks to our server sharing that the sauce is better on the side! Fries were also perfect and we headed back to the road fulfilled.',\n",

Great beer selection, good drinks, great bar and outdoor seating. I mark them down for the service being spotty. I go here with some frequency as there are good options for the kids, so I like feed. I just wish the service was more consistent.\",\n",

The live music on the enclosed and temp controlled patio was great entertainment. We wanted to get the meatloaf- it looked AMAZING- but they ran out. So go early and get the meatloaf if you go! We got the country fried steak and the French dip sandwich. Both were excellent. Even the kid's food was awesome. Draft beer was extra cold. The restaurant was decorated nicely and appeared to be in a nice part of town. I'm glad we waited!\",\n",

The food was outstanding everything we had was prepared Perfect. great service . ambience could use step up, but still cute enough ..all the vegetables had something special done to them,  whiskey glaze Carrots, garlic, green beans. The southern fried chicken everything was just perfect and delicious. I did not have the pork chop, but he said it was prepared. Perfect one of the best he's ever had.Enough vegetarian items to keep the vegetarian in your life happy .\"]"
